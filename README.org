#+TITLE: =~/.emacs.d=

My literate configuration for the GNU Emacs system, managed using org-mode.

This repository contains several important files:
- init.org :: the main configuration file. tangled to init.el via org/ntangle
- snippets.org :: the file where my yasnippet snippets are stored. 
- unmanaged :: lisp code or other resources that are not substantial enough to be packaged
  - themes :: my personal emacs theme(s)
  - icons :: png icons taken from [[http://emacs.sexy][emacs.sexy]]
- straight :: directory where straight.el stores its files.
  - versions/defaut.el :: lockfile for straight.el
- var :: managed by no-littering.el
- etc :: managed by no-littering.el

In the future this repo will also contain a valid nix expression for the ntangle tool, which I use to tangle my org-mode configuration files.
