#+TITLE: =~/.emacs.d=

My non-literate configuration for the GNU Emacs text editor/operating system.

Currently, among other things, contains a customized theme 
and dashboard based on [[http://emacs.sexy/][emacs.sexy]].

This configuration makes heavy use of the great
[[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] for configuration management,
and also defines a new =use-config= macro.
